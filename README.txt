This repo contains a MATLAB port of the wet bulb temperature code from HumanIndexMod 04-08-16.
It is not maintained or supported, and it was validated at the time of its development in 2016
only to the extent of ensuring that it reproduced targeted results from the original FORTRAN code. 

Subsequent improvements and bug fixes in HumanIndexMod are not represented here and will not be 
represented here. This code is provided under the terms of the MIT license with the recommendation
that it be used only for educational purposes and should not be used for production without validation.
